# Welcome

As I took Mosh's Node.js Course, I coded with him and this is the repo where I use to store everything I've learned in the course. Most notably, the `vidly-project` folder contains the final project of this course. I've created a web app using **Express**, **Node**, and **MongoDB** which is the backend of a movie rental platform.
